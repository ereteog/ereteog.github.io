        I am an R&D engineer and backend developer with a special interest on Semantic Web, Social Network Analysis, Information Retrieval and Functional Programming.
    </p>
<p>
    I am currently working at Vigiglobe, since September 2014, on a social media analytics platform which mines and aggregates thousands of messages per second in real time. We are fully developing this application with functional programming languages (90% in Clojure, 10% in Haskell) and NoSQL frameworks including Elasticsearch, Redis, MongoDB, Druid and Kafka. I have in particular developed components for brand recognition, geolocation, textual search, and statistical trend detection.

I have acquired my experience in various types of organizations (academic, big corporation and startups). I have started with a Ph.D. thesis at Orange Labs (in collaboration with INRIA and Telecom ParisTech) on semantic social network analysis. My results were published in proceedings of both national and international conferences, including the International Semantic Web Conference. In 2011, I joined Orangeâ€™s search engine team where I build a knowledge base that supply both internal business intelligence tools and search engine components. This knowledge base was aggregating heterogeneous data from both internal sources and external ones and was taking advantage of Semantic Web technologies to reifer identities, align models and infer/recover data. This knowledge base was in particular used to detect named entities (ex: brands, persons, places) in query logs to helps marketing team understanding customer needs. I was hired in April 2013 by Mnemotix as an R&D engineer and Semantic Web developer. My main contribution was the development of a semantic layer to link autonomous medical databases for conducting large-scale epidemiologic analysis.
